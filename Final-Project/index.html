<blockquote cite="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/05/26/why-is-van-gogh-so-popular-50-anniversary-emilie-gordenker">
- Van Goghâ€™s paintings are colourful, his subject matter is appealing, it is varied, he is very direct. His life was one of working against the odds: the difficulties that he surmounted represents a fascinating story, one offering solace and hope. There is a freshness and immediacy to his work. Every generation seems to rediscover him.
